Dependencies that may cause trouble:
SMS OTP -> Twilio (in debug mode the otp is logged to get around it if you want to)
You will not be able to receive the SMS OTP using the Twilio account specified in
secret-keys.config

Anti-Virus Scanning -> nClam (need to set up a nClam server)

Database:
Our project uses MySQL
MySQL connection data is located in ASPJ_Project\connection-strings.config
By default the project will try to connect to localhost:3360 using
username : root
password : mySQL1saroot
Import dububase_compile.sql for all the tables
